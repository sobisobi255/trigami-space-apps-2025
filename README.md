# 🚀 TRIGAMI: Adaptive Living Spaces for Low Earth Orbit

> “What if space could adapt to people, instead of people always adapting to space?”

**TRIGAMI** is a **triangular modular interior system** for space habitats. Using foldable carbon-fiber tiles and AR-guided software, it creates adaptable spaces that **cut mass by 15%**, saving millions per mission while making orbital living **flexible, sustainable, and human-centered**.

## 🌍 Overview

As commercialization of **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** accelerates, space habitats face critical challenges: rigid interiors, limited space, and high launch costs. Astronauts and tourists adapt to the environment instead of it adapting to them — making orbital living uncomfortable and unsustainable.

TRIGAMI reimagines interiors as **transformable**, not fixed. Inspired by the **diamond’s triangular structure**, our modular tiles can fold and lock to form different configurations, supported by an **AR-guided companion app**. This enables **human-centered, efficient, and sustainable living** beyond Earth.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

- 💰 Launch cost: $10,000–$20,000 per kg  
- 🚪 Rigid furniture → wasted space & money  
- 👨‍🚀 Less than 55 m³ per astronaut inside ISS  
- 🌍 Environmental impact from excess payload  
- 🧭 Social exclusivity due to cost barriers

## 💡 Solution

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🟦 **Modular Tiles** | Equilateral carbon-fiber triangles with hinge-latch systems |
| 🧠 **Smart Hinges** | Lock at 0°, 60°, 120°; fold in under a minute |
| 🧰 **TRIGAMI SHIFTS App** | 3D AR overlays, layout presets, safety checks |
| ♻ **Sustainability** | 15% mass reduction → $20–30M savings per mission |

## 📅 Roadmap

Hackathon (current): Concept, Figma prototype, video, README.

Short term: Build a physical tile & hinge prototype; TRIGAMI SHIFTS basic AR walkthrough.

Testing: Parabolic flights → ISS mockups → commercial station demos.

Scale: Integrate with commercial LEO stations; adapt for lunar/Mars habitats.

---

## 🏆 Judging Criteria Alignment

Impact: tangible payload savings and improved livability.

Creativity: origami-inspired folding geometry + AR control.

Validity: materials & costs informed by real ISS/LEO data.

Relevance: directly answers “Commercializing LEO.”

Presentation: clear demo + 240s video + Figma prototype.
